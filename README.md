# Rag
RAG to elevate AI potential!
Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), is a technique that combines the capabilities of a pre-trained large language model with an external data source. This approach combines the generative power of LLMs with the precision of specialized data search mechanisms, resulting in a system that can offer nuanced responses.
